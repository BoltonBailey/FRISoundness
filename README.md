This is a Lean 4 project that aims to provide a formal blueprint for the soundness of the FRI protocol. [The blueprint page can be found here](https://boltonbailey.github.io/FRISoundness/).

The project is not being actively worked on, but is meant to follow the proof of Theorem 8.2 of "Proximity Gap for Reed-Solomon Codes" by [Ben-Sasson et al](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/654.pdf). Ideally, I would like a blueprint with all the theorems and definitions from that paper, as well as from any other papers that this one references for critical lemmas (such as the Polischuk Spielman result).
