\chapter*{Overview}

This Lean Blueprint seeks to be a guide towards the development of a formal proof of Theorem 8.2/8.3 of "Proximity Gaps for Reed Solomon Codes" by Ben-Sasson et al.:

\begin{lemma}[8.2] \label{Batched FRI error bound}
  Let $V^{(0)} = \mathrm{RS}[\mathbb{F},\mathcal{D}^{(0)},k^{(0)}]$ where $\mathcal{D}^{(0)}$ is a coset of a
  2-smooth multiplicative group, and $k^{(0)} + 1$ is a power of 2; set $\rho = (k^{(0)} + 1)/|\mathcal{D}^{(0)}|$.

  Let $F \subseteq \mathbb{F}^{\mathcal{D}^{(0)}}$ be a space of functions as defined in Eq. (8.3) whose correlated agreement density
  with $V^{(0)}$ is at most $\alpha$. For integer $m \geq 3$, let
  \[\alpha^{(0)}(\rho,m) = \max\{\alpha, \sqrt{\rho}(1+1/2m)\}.\]
  Assume the FRI protocol is used with $r$ rounds, and let $l^{(i)} = |\mathcal{D}^{(i)}|/|\mathcal{D}^{(i+1)}|$ denote the ratio between
  prover messages (oracles) $i$ and $i+1$. Let $\epsilon_Q$ denote the probability that the verifier accepts a single
  FRI QUERY invocation. Then,
  \[
  \underset{x_1,\ldots,x_t,z^{(0)},\ldots,z^{(r-1)}}{\mathrm{Pr}}[\epsilon_Q > \alpha^{(0)}(\rho,m)] \leq \epsilon_C,
  \]
  where
  \[
  \epsilon_C = \frac{(m+\frac{1}{2})^7 \cdot |\mathcal{D}^{(0)}|^2}{2\rho^{3/2}|\mathbb{F}|} + \frac{(2m+1) \cdot (|\mathcal{D}^{(0)}|+1)}{\sqrt{\rho}} \cdot \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{r-1}l^{(i)}}{|\mathbb{F}|}.
  \]

  In words: For any interactive FRI prover $P^*$, the probability that the oracles $f^{(0)},\ldots,f^{(r)}$ sent
  by $P^*$ will pass a single invocation of the batched FRI QUERY test with probability greater than
  $\alpha^{(0)}(\rho,m)$, is smaller than $\epsilon_C$. The probability is over the random variables $x_1,\ldots,x_t$ used to sample
  $f^{(0)}$ from $F$ and over the random messages $z^{(0)},\ldots,z^{(r-1)}$ sent by the verifier during the COMMIT
  phase.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[8.3] \label{Batched FRI Soundness}
  Let $f_0^{(0)},\ldots,f_t^{(0)} : \mathcal{D}^{(0)} \to \mathbb{F}$ be a sequence of functions
  and let $V^{(0)} = \mathrm{RS}[\mathbb{F},\mathcal{D}^{(0)},k^{(0)}]$ where $\mathcal{D}^{(0)}$ is a coset of a 2-smooth group of size $n^{(0)} = |\mathcal{D}^{(0)}|$, and
  $\rho = \frac{k^{(0)}+1}{n^{(0)}}$ satisfies $\rho = 2^{-R}$ for positive integer $R$. Let $\alpha = \sqrt{\rho}(1+1/2m)$ for integer $m \geq 3$ and $\epsilon_C$
  be as defined in Lemma 8.2.

  Assume the FRI protocol is used with $r$ rounds. Let $l^{(i)} = |\mathcal{D}^{(i)}|/|\mathcal{D}^{(i+1)}|$ denote the ratio between
  prover messages (oracles) $i$ and $i+1$. Assume furthermore that $s$ is the number of invocations of
  the FRI QUERY step.

  Suppose there exists a batched FRI prover $P^*$ that interacts with the batched FRI verifier and
  causes it to output "accept" with probability greater than

  \[\epsilon_{\mathrm{FRI}} := \epsilon_C + \alpha^s = \frac{\left(m+\frac{1}{2}\right)^7 \cdot |\mathcal{D}^{(0)}|^2}{2\rho^{3/2}|\mathbb{F}|} + \frac{(2m+1) \cdot (|\mathcal{D}^{(0)}|+1)}{\sqrt{\rho}} \cdot \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} l^{(i)}}{|\mathbb{F}|} + \left(\sqrt{\rho} \cdot \left(1+\frac{1}{2m}\right)\right)^s.\]

  Then $f_0^{(0)},\ldots,f_t^{(0)}$ have correlated agreement with $V^{(0)}$ on a domain $\mathcal{D}' \subset \mathcal{D}^{(0)}$ of density at
  least $\alpha$.
  \uses{Batched FRI error bound}
\end{theorem}

I would like the blueprint to reflect the entire dependency tree of this theorem, including all the results from this paper and any critical results from other papers. Here is an intermediate result:

\begin{theorem}[6.1]
  Suppose $\delta \leq (1-\rho)/2$. Let $u_0, u_1, \ldots, u_l : \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{F}_q$ be functions. Let
  \[
  S = \{z \in \mathbb{F}_q : \Delta(u_0 + zu_1 + \cdots + z^lu_l, V) \leq \delta\}
  \]
  and suppose $|S| > l \cdot n$. Then for all $z \in \mathbb{F}_q$ we have
  \[
  \Delta(u_0 + zu_1 + \cdots + z^lu_l, V) \leq \delta,
  \]
  and furthermore there are $v_0, \ldots, v_l \in V$ such that for all $z \in \mathbb{F}_q$,
  \[
  \Delta(u_0 + zu_1 + \cdots + z^lu_l, v_0 + zv_1 + \cdots + z^lv_l) \leq \delta
  \]
  and in fact
  \[
  |\{x \in \mathcal{D} : (u_0(x), \ldots, u_l(x)) \neq (v_0(x), \ldots, v_l(x))\}| \leq \delta|\mathcal{D}|.
  \]
\end{theorem}
